# simple-airline-booking
This is a sample type for the regular airline reservation system we see in daily basic. This system was designed using Java and GUI. The purpose of building this system was to make a system that is more user-friendly and saves each booking in order in a text file. Different classes and methods were used to build this system to break the coding into small parts, which made it easier to understand and fix if any problem arises in the future.
